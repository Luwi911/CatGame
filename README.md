# Assignment 03

**Course Title**: Web Development

**Course Code**: IRM1005 / ITEC1005

**Due Date**: November 16th, 11:59PM

**Assessment**: This assignment is worth 15% of your final grade and marked out of 100.

## TLDR

1. Initialise an array and complete the five functions in the `part-1.js` file.
2. Run the automated tests and view results in the console.
3. Modify `part-2.js` to add functionality to the `todo.html` webpage
3. Commit your code to your assignment repository in GitHub.
4. Turn on GitHub Pages in your repository to host your web page online.


## Description

Part 1 will assess your ability to write basic JavaScript, including variable declaration, array manipulation, function creation, and using `console.log()` to output data to the console.

Part 2 will assess your ability to manipulate the DOM and work with JavaScript events. 

Students will also be assessed on their ability to commit their code to GitHub and activate the GitHub pages service.

### Part 1

Create and host a web page that meets the following requirements:

- Follow all instructions provided in the `part-1.js` file to complete part 1 of the assignment
- Initialise an array of todo items
- Complete the five functions in the `part-1.js` file
- Do not modify the automated test file in any way
- Run the automated tests to ensure your code is working correctly
- No errors should be present 
- All tests should pass
- To be awarded an A, you need add some error checking in your functions, this means adding code in your functions to check if the user input is garbage (like trying to delete a todo ID that doesn't exist, or trying to create a todo by passing a number instead of a string)

### Part 2

- Follow all instructions provided in the `todo.html` file to complete part 2 of the assignment
- Implement the requested functionality by editing `part-2.js` to make changes to the DOM based off of events triggered by the user
- Test the functionality of your to-do list by adding many items, deleting some of them in random order, toggling some items, and clearing completed items

### For Both Parts

- You must use the GitHub Repository generated by GitHub Classrooms for the assignment
- Web page must be hosted using GitHub Pages service
- Web page must be reachable by a browser on the public internet

## Acceptance criteria

- Do not modify the test file in any way
- Publish your code on GitHub using the GitHub classrooms generated repository
- Use the GitHub Pages service to host your web page
- GitHub time stamps on your project files will be used to asses when the assignment was submitted

## Grading rubric

The JavaScript code that you are writing in this assignment 03 is worth 15% of your final grade and marked out of 100.
